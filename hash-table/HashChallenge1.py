# Instructions:
# HT: Item In Common (âš¡Interview Question)
# Write a function item_in_common(list1, list2) that takes two lists as input and returns True
# if there is at least one common item between the two lists, False otherwise.
# Use a dictionary to solve the problem that creates an O(n) time complexity.

def item_in_common(list1, list2):
    dict = {}

    for i in list1:
        dict[i] = True

    for i in list2:
        if i in dict:
            return True
    return False

list1 = [1,3,5]
list2 = [2,4,5]

print(item_in_common(list1, list2))
