# Instructions:
# Set: Find Pairs (âš¡Interview Question)
# You are given two lists of integers, arr1 and arr2, and a target integer value, target.
# Your task is to find all pairs of numbers (one from arr1 and one from arr2) whose sum equals target.
# Write a function called find_pairs that takes in three arguments: arr1, arr2, and target,
# and returns a list of all such pairs.

def find_pairs(arr1, arr2, target):
    set1 = set(arr1)
    pairs = []
    for num in arr2:
        complement = target - num
        if complement in set1:
            pairs.append((complement, num))
    return pairs

arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
target = 7

pairs = find_pairs(arr1, arr2, target)
print (pairs)
