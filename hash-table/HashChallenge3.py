# Instructions:
# HT: First Non-Repeating Character (âš¡Interview Question)
# You have been given a string of lowercase letters.
# Write a function called first_non_repeating_char(string) that finds the first non-repeating character
# in the given string using a hash table (dictionary).
# If there is no non-repeating character in the string, the function should return None.
# For example, if the input string is "leetcode", the function should return "l" because "l"
# is the first character that appears only once in the string. Similarly, if the input string is "hello",
# the function should return "h" because "h" is the first non-repeating character in the string.

def first_non_repeating_char(string):
    counts = {}

    for l in string:
        if l not in counts:
            counts[l] = 1
        else:
            counts[l] += 1

    for l in string:
        if counts[l] == 1:
            return l
    return False

string = "leetcode"
