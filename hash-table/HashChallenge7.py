# Instructions:
# Set: Remove Duplicates (⚡Interview Question)
# You have been given a list my_list with some duplicate values.
# Your task is to write a Python program that removes all the duplicates from the list using a set and
# then prints the updated list.
# You need to implement a function remove_duplicates(my_list) that takes in the input list my_list
# as a parameter and returns a new list with no duplicates.
# Your function should not modify the original list, instead, it should create a new list with
# unique values and return it.


def remove_duplicates(my_list):
    new_list = list(set(my_list))
    return new_list


my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
new_list = remove_duplicates(my_list)
print(new_list)
