# Instructions: LL: Partition List (âš¡Interview Question)
# You are given a singly linked list implementation in Python that does not have a tail pointer
# (which will make this method simpler to implement).
# You are tasked with implementing a method partition_list(self, x)
# that will take an integer x and partition the linked list such that all nodes with values
# less than x come before nodes with values greater than or equal to x.
# You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.
# You need to implement this method as a method of the LinkedList class.
# The method should take an integer x as input. If the linked list is empty, the method should return None.
