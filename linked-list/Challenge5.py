# Instructions: LL: Reverse Between (âš¡Interview Question)
# You are given a singly linked list and two integers m and n.
# Your task is to write a method reverse_between within the LinkedList class that
# reverses the nodes of the linked list from index m to index n (inclusive) in one pass and in-place.
# Input - The method reverse_between takes two integer inputs m and n.
# The method will only be passed valid indexes (you do not need to test whether the indexes are out of bounds)
# Output - The method should modify the linked list in-place by reversing the nodes from index m to index n.
# If the linked list is empty or has only one node, the method should return None.
# Example
# Suppose the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, and m = 2 and n = 4.
# Then, the method should modify the linked list to 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 .
# Constraints - The algorithm should run in one pass and in-place, with a time complexity of O(n)
# and a space complexity of O(1).

    # Dummy node to reset head incase reverse started from the beginning
    # Loop to set previous to m value

    # Remove current.next (temp) out of the main link
    # Add removed node after previous value
    # Make previous next node the temp node
    # Loop repeats until the range is reversed
